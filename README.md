# goodbits

A list of good things.

## Add to the list

Make a commit adding a line of JSON to [list.ndjson](./list.ndjson). The file format is [newline delimited json](http://ndjson.org/).

Any value that's a JSON string will be interpreted as a generically 'good' CID.

Make your entry a JSON object with a `"cid"` property to express what kind of goodness should be associated with the CID.
